Summaries and exercises from my "Introduction to algorithms" reading

Chapters' explanations
======================

Introduction to start thinking how to design and analyze algorithms. It introduces how to specify algorithms, some design strategies and fundamental ideas in algorithm analysis.

Chapter 1 presents the algorithms in the context of modern computing systems. It provides an algorithm definition and consider some examples of algorithms as a technology.

The Role of Algorithms in Computing
===================================

Informal definition for algorithm
---------------------------------

An algorithm is a set of well-defined *computational steps* to apply on a set of *inputs* to produce a set of result values as *outputs*.

As an alternative definition we can view an algorithm as *tool* for solving a well-defined *computational problem*. The problem is defined in terms of the relation between a set of desired *outputs* derived from the provided *inputs*.

As a *instance of a problem* we know the *inputs* provided to fulfill the algorithm's constrains.

An algorithm is said to be correct if for every input *instance*, it halts with the correspondence *outputs*.

Data structures
---------------

> A data structure is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications. No single data structure works well for all purposes, and so it is important to know the strengths and limitations of several of them.
